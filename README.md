# TheDeepLearningHouse (CNN Part 3)
####  Welcome to the House. In this, you will: 
1. Learn to use Keras, a high-level neural networks API (programming framework), written in Python
and capable of running on top of several lower-level frameworks including TensorFlow and CNTK. 
2. See how you can in a couple of hours build a deep learning algorithm.

#### HappyHouse Problem Statement: 
Consider for your next vacation, you decided to spend a week with five of your friends from school. 
It is a very convenient house with many things to do nearby. But the most important benefit is that 
everybody has commited to be happy when they are in the house. So anyone wanting to enter the house 
must prove their current state of happiness. 

**We develop keras based deep neural network that classifies happy and sad faces using computer vision**

### Dependencies:
1. Python 3.6
2. Numpy
3. Keras with tensorflow backend
4. Matplotlib
5. pydot

### Step by Step Implementation of HappyHouse:
- [x] Install all the latest dependencies.
- [x] Clone the repository in your local system.
- [x] Make sure all folders are in same location
- [x] Open any python3.6 IDE and execute HappyHouse.py
- [x] Visualize the results. 

*If you want to test with you own image, then the replace your picture in images folder
and execute HappyHouse.py, Hopefully it should work* 
> Note: Make sure the dimension of image is matched with the originally tested one.

**The Repository also has notebook(.ipynb) file, which has detailed explnation of
project and also implmentation steps, do check it out once**

> Thank You, cheers. :+1:
